# Fixed Netlify Deployment Guide

## The Problem We Fixed
The original deployment package was failing because Vite was looking for `./client/index.html` but our deployment structure was different.

## What We Fixed
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to use correct file paths
- Simplified build configuration 
- Removed client folder references
- Fixed package.json scripts

## How to Deploy to Netlify (Step by Step)

### Method 1: Direct Upload (Easiest)
1. Download `netlify-deployment-fixed.zip`
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up/login
4. Drag the extracted folder directly onto the Netlify dashboard
5. Your site deploys automatically in 2-3 minutes

### Method 2: GitHub Integration  
1. Create a GitHub account at [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Create a new repository called `my-portfolio`
3. Upload all extracted files to the repository
4. Go to Netlify and click "New site from Git"
5. Connect your GitHub account
6. Select your `my-portfolio` repository
7. Build settings are automatically detected:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
8. Click "Deploy site"

## Build Configuration
The deployment package includes:
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration
- `vite.config.ts` - Fixed Vite build setup

- `_redirects` - SPA routing rules

## Your Portfolio Features
- Rotating gradient cube background

The fixed package should deploy without any build errors on Netlify.
